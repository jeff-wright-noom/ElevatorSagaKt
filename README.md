# ElevatorSagaKt

## Purpose:
Play [Elevator Saga](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/), but use a language that isn't garbage.

## Get started:
1. Run `./gradlew outputJS`
2. Paste the contents of `build/output.js` into https://play.elevatorsaga.com/


[The Elevator Saga's API, defined in Kotlin](src/main/kotlin/ElevatorApi.kt)

[A naive start](src/main/kotlin/Main.kt)

## Next Steps:
I don't have DCE turned on, so the result is super bloated.  But it runs fine!
